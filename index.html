A million thank yous go to The Fake VIP himself for letting me use his <a href=https://github.com/mcb2003/tfvip-site>website template</a>.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s steal TheFake VIP&rsquo;s &ldquo;Break it Down&rdquo; gimmick, because I can:</p><dl><dt>Why Dan Gero</dt><dd><p>The story behind that is interesting. I was playing a game that allowed people to build their own environments (maps) for other people to challenge themselves with. If you won the map, you received coins which you could use to buy perks to make the game easier to play. Anyway, someone created a map called &ldquo;Dangerous Mountain&rdquo;&mldr; Except they didn&rsquo;t call it that. They misspelled &ldquo;Dangerous&rdquo; as &ldquo;Dangeros&rdquo;. My screen reader pronounced it like &ldquo;Dan Gero&rsquo;s Mountain&rdquo;, so I decided right then and there to use that name as my official online name. I&rsquo;m glad I have that name now, because I actually like it much more than my own name. (No offense Mom and Dad, I love you.)</p></dd><dt>Wait, what&rsquo;s a Screen reader?</dt><dd><p>Great question! A screen reader is software on a device that reads text on the screen aloud to a person who&rsquo;s unable to read it themselves, i.e., someone who is blind or visually impaired.</p></dd><dt>Wait&mldr; You&rsquo;re visually impaired?</dt><dd><p>Indeed I am! At 22-months-old, I was attacked by a German shepherd. The accident left me with some fairly wicked facial injuries, as well as severe vision damage. That doesn&rsquo;t stop me from living my life and doing the things I love to do though.</p></dd><dt>Musician</dt><dd><p>Well, I use the term <strong>musician</strong> fairly loosely here, but I have my moments. I&rsquo;m not the best, but I&rsquo;m certainly not the worst. I can play basic chords on a keyboard, but step recording is where I shine the most. I think I&rsquo;m pretty decent at mixing and adding effects as well, but I like to send my work to professionals to make sure I&rsquo;m doing things the right way. I would love to be able to play the piano though, and I would love to be at a professional level when it comes to production work. My DAW of choice is <a href=https://www.reaper.fm/>Reaper</a>, and the keyboard I use is the [Komplete Kontrol M32](<a href=https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/keyboards/komplete-kontrol-m32/%5D>https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/keyboards/komplete-kontrol-m32/]</a> from <a href=https://www.native-instruments.com/>Native Instruments</a></p></dd><dt>Vocaloid producer</dt><dd><p>I love Vocaloid music with a passion. I won&rsquo;t say I love it with <strong>all</strong> of my heart and soul, because that would leave no room for my friends, family, or any other hobby/career path I partake in during my spare time. What I will say is that Vocaloid and vocal synths in general hold a special place in my heart, and hopefully that will never change for as long as I live. Vocaloid has some major accessibility issues that make it difficult to use, but I&rsquo;ve found ways of working around its inaccessible interface. <a href=https://vocalsynth.fandom.com/wiki/Vocal_Synthesizer_Wiki>Click here for more information on the different Vocal Synths that available</a>, and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocaloid>Click here for information about Vocaloid specifically</a></p></dd><dt>Open Source Advocate</dt><dd><p>The Fake VIP put it best himself, so I&rsquo;ll keep his paragraph below, then I&rsquo;ll add my thoughts afterwards..</p><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m a huge proponent of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software>free, libre</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software>open source</a> software. Developing the software that runs our lives out in the open increases security, encourages innovation, prevents monopolistic practices and above all, makes technology accessible to everyone.</p><p>I&rsquo;m also a believer in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_social_network>a decentralized, federated</a> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(web_services)>self-hosted</a> web and projects like <a href=https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/>ActivityPub</a>, <a href=https://joinmastodon.org>Mastodon</a>, <a href=https://matrix.org/>Matrix</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent>Bit Torrent</a>, and <a href=https://nextcloud.com>Next Cloud</a>.</p></blockquote><p>I would like to add that unfortunately, all other known Vocal Synth programs in the market are completely unusable for us, as far as I understand it. This even includes versions of Vocaloid after version 4. Most Vocal Synth programs are also close sourced, so creating accessibility fixes, plugins, scripts, or any other solutions is considerably more difficult. When it comes to open sourced programs, however, it increases the chances of someone being able to work on accessibility solutions. It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that someone <strong>will</strong> work on a solution; it means that someone <strong>can</strong> work on a solution. I&rsquo;d like to go more in depth about Vocal Synths and the benefits of the Open Source Movement as it relates to these programs in my blog, so definitely stay tuned for that.</p></dd><dt>Geek</dt><dd><p>Well, it&rsquo;s true, you know? I&rsquo;m a geek, and I&rsquo;m proud of it! Geeks run this world after all, right?</p></dd></dl></main><footer class=footer><div class="container-fluid text-center">Copyright &copy; 2023
